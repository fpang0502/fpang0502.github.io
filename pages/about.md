Hi there! I'm Frank. I am a junior at the University of Southern California majoring in Computer Science. I'm passionate about mHealth (mobile health), software development and creating products that improve people's lives.

This past summer, I was a Commercialization Intern at Oceanit Laboratories, an Engineering Consulting company based in Honolulu, HI. There, I applied Design Thinking strategies and worked on iOS development for customized aviation masks using Apple's TrueDepth API. In addition, I managed the company's multi-site on WordPress hosted on Amazon Web Services by making website page speed optimizations, creating content/designing product websites, installing HTTPS and even automating website backups. To learn a little more about the work I've been doing, check out my projects!

I hope that this website helps you get to know me a bit better and I look forward to all that I'm about to learn in the coming years!
